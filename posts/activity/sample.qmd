The Name of my tool is Pathmaker. I wanted to keep it simple and help explain what it's main purpose is. Since it's related to path-finding and currently is mostly for creating and editing maps to use as a environment for testing path-finding algorithms I believe the name Pathmaker fits the theme a purpose of the project and explains what it's used for.
