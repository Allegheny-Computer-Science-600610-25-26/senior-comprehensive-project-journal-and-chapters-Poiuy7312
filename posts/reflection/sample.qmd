Overall I think the Presentation went pretty well. I was a little but worried I might not have enough to talk about but looking back at my junior sem presentation helped me think about things I could add and talk about. I do think I could have made it a little more clear what the projects goals and target audience was. But other than that I think it went pretty well I don't believe there where any major gaps in the presentation and I covered a little bit of everything.
