  abstract={Autonomous robotic navigation in unknown and complex environment as mazes is an important task for the wheeled mobile robots. Different algorithms have been used to deal with this problem, where the most known are based on optimization processes in order to find the optimal path safely. The present paper describes an implementation of a simple maze-solving algorithms based on Arduino-UNO card. The two versions of flood-fill algorithms are used for mobile robot maze navigation: the basic version of flood-fill algorithm (FFA) and the modified flood-fill algorithm (MFFA). Ultrasonic sensors are used to perceive, detect walls and the maze shape. The obtained experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of these implemented algorithms to autonomous robot navigation. In all cases, the controlled wheeled mobile robot is able to move in the maze safely, and can solve it effectively and autonomously.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose a new path planning algorithm based on the probabilistic roadmaps method (PRM), in order to effectively solve the autonomous path planning of mobile robots in complex environments with multiple narrow channels. The improved PRM algorithm mainly improves the density and distribution of sampling points in the narrow channel, through a combination of the learning process of the PRM algorithm and the APF algorithm. We also shortened the required time and path length by optimizing the query process. The first key technology to improve the PRM algorithm involves optimizing the number and distribution of free points and collision-free lines in the free workspace. To ensure full visibility of the narrow channel, we extend the obstacles through the diagonal distance of the mobile robot while ignoring the safety distance. Considering the safety distance during movement, we re-classify the all sampling points obtained by the quasi-random sampling principle into three categories: free points, obstacle points, and adjacent points. Next, we transform obstacle points into the free points of the narrow channel by combining the APF algorithm and the characteristics of the narrow channel, increasing the density of sampling points in the narrow space. Then, we include potential energy judgment into the construction process of collision-free lines shortening the required time and reduce collisions with obstacles. Optimizing the query process of the PRM algorithm is the second key technology. To reduce the required time in the query process, we adapt the bidirectional A* algorithm to query these local paths and obtain an effective path to the target point. We also combine the path pruning technology with the potential energy function to obtain a short path without collisions. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the new PRM path planning technology can improve the density of free points in narrow spaces and achieve an optimized, collision-free path in complex environments with multiple narrow channels.},
